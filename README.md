# Quantum Mechanics Applications

Welcome!

This is a **learning-focused repository** where we explore Quantum Mechanics from the ground up. Whether you're a student, a curious developer, or someone new to quantum physics, you're welcome here!

## About This Project

This repository documents my journey as a Computer Science undergraduate learning Quantum Mechanics through hands-on mini-projects and practical implementations. The goal is to make quantum concepts accessible and fun by combining theory with code.

**Everyone is invited to join!** Whether you're:
- Just starting to learn about quantum mechanics
- Interested in quantum computing
- Curious about implementing quantum algorithms
- Looking to collaborate and learn together

Feel free to explore the projects, ask questions, and contribute your own ideas!

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need:
- A C++ compiler (g++, clang, or MSVC)
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library for linear algebra
- Basic understanding of C++ (quantum knowledge not required!)

## Current Projects

- `test_eigen.cpp` - Introduction to Eigen library for quantum computations

## Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

The executable will be created in the `build/bin/` directory.

## Contributing

Have ideas for quantum projects? Found bugs? Want to add features? All contributions are welcome! Feel free to:
- Submit issues and suggestions
- Create pull requests with improvements
- Share your own quantum mechanics implementations
